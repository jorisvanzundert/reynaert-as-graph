OCRParser was developed specifically to parse the OCRed text of the accompanying edition of "Of Reynaert the Fox" by Andr√© Bouwman and Bart Besamusca. However it is setup according to a visitor pattern which should allow for some reuse with limited coding.

{OCRParser} is a good place to start exploring this package.
