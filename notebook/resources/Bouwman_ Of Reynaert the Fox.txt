1 AMiddle Dutch story about Madoc has not come down to us, but there are strong indi—
cations that a work with this title did at one time exist. Willem’s earlier tale probably told of a
dream that Madoc had, as seems to be suggested in Maerlant’s Rijmbijbel (cf. p. 16). Madoc is

sometimes considered to have been a story about a seafarer’s adventures.

6 It has been suggested that Van den v05 Reynaerde was written by two poets and that Wil—
lem completed Arnout’s unﬁnished work. However, serious objections may be raised to this
notion of joint authorship. Assuming that the name was not an invention, it seems probable,
also in view of the emphatic Walsch—Dietsch (French—Dutch) contrast in the lines before and

after the name, that Arnout was a French Renartpoet (cf. p. 15).
13 dorpren (‘peasants’) refers to non—courtly persons.

Prologue

Willem who made Madocke,

which often kept him awake,

was so extremely annoyed

that the tales of Reynaert

— which Arnout has not ﬁnished —

remained unwritten in Dutch

that he had the life looked for

and, following the French books,

he began it in Dutch as follows.

May God favour us with his help!
NowI am ofa mind

to urge at this beginning

both peasants and fools

whenever they happen to hear

the rhyme and these words

(which are wasted on them),

that they leave them unchanged.

They too much resemble the raven

who always thinks he knows it all.

They claim that many verses are untrue

which they know no more ab out

than I know what the people are called

who now live in Babylon.

If they were sensible, they would give up.
I am not saying this for myself.

Iwould not have written this poem

if a certain lady had not asked me

who likes to conduct her affairs

23 Babilonien (‘Babylon’) is used here in ahyperbolic comparison to indicate a proverbially
distant, foreign place. It may well be the case that the oblique reference to biblical Babylon,
the scene of linguistic ‘babel’, is intentional. Genesis 11 describes how building the tower of
Babel led to the rise of multiple languages and the resulting confusion and incomprehension
among people.

26 Literally the Middle Dutch phrase reads: ‘my poetry writing would only be silence’.
26-31 Willem claims to have written his verse romance at the request of a courtly lady,
whom he does not, however, name. It is usually assumed that, rather than having a real,
existing person in mind, the poet parodied the medieval custom of dedicating writings to
the nobility, and especially to noble women.

in a very courtly manner.

She asked me to make

this story about Reynaert.
Although I denounce the nit-pickers
and the peasants and the fools,
Iwish it to be heard by those

who like to act honourably

and put their minds

to living in a courtly way,

whether they be poor or rich,

and who will understand it properly.
Now hear how I begin!

King Nobel holds court

It was on a day at Whitsuntide

when trees and shrubbery alike

were dressed all over with green leaves.
Nobel the King had had

his court-day proclaimed everywhere,
which, he thought, — all being well —
would greatly increase his fame.

Then came to the king’s court

all the animals, large and small,

except for Reynaert the fox alone.

He had behaved so badly at court

that he did not dare go.

Whoever is knowingly guilty, is afraid.
This was the case with Reynaert

and that is why he avoided the king’s court
where his esteem was low.

When the entire court had gathered

there was nobody, except the badger,

who did not have some reason for complaining of

opening scene of Van den v05 Reynaerde stands in the tradition of many medieval Arthurian
romances, in which the king holds court on Ascension Day or at Whitsun.

62-71 In the course of the court day Ysingrijn the wolf, supported by his relatives, brings
charges against Reynaert. Medieval feudal society initially lacked a strong, central source
of authority. The authorities usually prosecuted only after the injured party had made a for—
mal complaint. See also the ‘complaint’ made by Cortoys, and by Pancer/Cuwaert and Can—
tecleer later in the story.

72-77 In branch 11 ofthe Roman de Renart (Martin 1882—1887, 1027—1396) the foxﬁnds him—
self in the wolves’ lair by accident. After Haersint, the she—wolf, has agreed to have sexual
intercourse with Reynaert, the latter urinates on her cubs and leaves the lair. Once her hus—
band has returned, the she—wolf tries to convince him without much success that she has
been raped. A few days later the two wolves chase the fox. When the she—wolf gets stuck in the

Reynaert, the scoundrel with the grey beard.
Now a charge is made against him.

Ysingrijn and his relatives

took up their positions before the king.

Ysingrijn began at once

and said: ‘My Lord King,

for the sake of your nobility and of your honour,

and for the sake of justice and of mercy,

take pity on the harm

inﬂicted upon me by Reynaert,

through whom I have often incurred

great humiliation and loss.

Take pity especially because

he has had his way with my wife

and has maltreated my children so badly

that, by pissing on them where they lay,

two of them lost their sight

and are now totally blind.

In addition he later disgraced me.

It had by then come to such a pass

that a day had been appointed

when Reynaert should swear

his innocence in court. But as soon

as the relics were brought,

he changed his mind

and escaped us in his stronghold.

My lord, this is well known among the highest

of those who have come here to court.

Reynaert, that vicious animal,

narrow entrance to the fox’s den, she is raped, in full view of the approaching wolf, by Ren—
art who has left his den by another exit. Ysingrijn’s complaint concerns the rape; for obvious
reasons he remains silent about his wife’s adultery (cf. pp. 32—33).

73 verhoert is ambiguous; apart from meaning ‘raped’, it refers to sexual fulﬁlment.

79-85 Reynaert’s escape when about to swear his innocence is seen in a differentlight when
the story onsingrijn’s devious plan, recounted in branch Va of the Roman de Renart, is taken
into account (Martin 1882—1887, 1091—1272). There the fox ﬂees because he discovers just in
time that the holy relics on which he was to swear were in fact the teeth of the dog Roonel,
who was shamming death. The wolf ’s biased version of events clearly demonstrates that he
is dissembling (cf. p. 33).

97 no onversweghen: onversweghen may be a scribal error for versweghen, but it could also be
argued that this is a slip of the tongue on Ysingrijn’s part (“nor not hushed up”).

107 Tybeert die cater: although the text speciﬁes that Tybeert is a male cat or tomcat, we
translate ‘cater’ as ‘cat’, in accordance with usual practice.

has done me so much harm,-

I am quite convinced:

if all the cloth now made in Ghent

were parchment, I should not have

enough to describe it all.

That is whyI prefer to be silent about it,

but my wife’s disgrace

must neither be overlooked,

nor not hushed up, nor remain without revenge.’
When Ysingrijn had spoken thus

a small dog stood up, called Cortoys,

and complained to the king in French

how a while ago it had been so poor

that it had had nothing left

one winter when there was a frost

except for one sausage

and that Reynaert, the scoundrel,

had stolen that very sausage from him.
Tybeert the cat was roused to fury.

This is how he began his speech

and he jumped into the middle of the circle

and he said: ‘My Lord King,

because you bear Reynaert ill will

there is no one here, young nor old,

or he has something to charge him with before you.

What Cortoys is complaining of now

happened many a year ago.

The sausage was mine, but I don’t complain.

Ihad got hold of it craftily

when one night, looking for something to bag,

Iwent into a mill

where I stole the sausage

from a sleeping miller.

If Cortoys proﬁted by it at all

107-25 Tybeert argues that Cortoys’ complaint is not admissible: the sausage belonged to
the cat, who in his turn had stolen it from a sleeping miller. As the miller was traditionally re—
nowned for sexual prowess in the Middle Ages, the sausage may have ambiguous implications.
117 lust is ambiguous, meaning both ‘clever trick’ as well as ‘lust’.

140-41 King Nobel has proclaimed peace, which meant that his subjects were not allowed
to carry weapons or to pursue old feuds. Reynaert’s attempt on Cuwaert’s life is, therefore,
also a breach of the king’s peace. This undermines Nobel’s authority, as Pancer the beaver
remarks at the end of his speech (165—69).

142-48 It has been suggested that the expressions maken capelaen (‘make chaplain’) and

155

this was entirely my doing.

It would only be right to dismiss

the complaint that Cortoys makes.’
Pancer the beaver spoke: ‘Do you think it right,

Tybeert, that the complaint should be dismissed?

Reynaert really is a murderer

and a cheat and a thief.

Also, there is nobody he likes so much,

not even my lord the king,

that he would not wish him to lose

life and honour if that might get him

a succulent bite of a chicken.

And a trap, what do you say of that?

Did he not yesterday, in broad daylight,

perpetrate one of the worst crimes

ever committed by any animal

against Cuwaert the hare, standing here?

For at a time when the king’s peace

and safe conduct have been proclaimed,

he promised to teach him the creed

and to make him chaplain.

Then he made him sit

tightly between his legs.

Together they began

to practice spelling and reading

and to sing the creed loudly.

It so happened that at this moment

Ipassed that place.

Then I heard them singing together

and went in that direction,

at a great speed.

Then I found master Reynaert there

who had ﬁnished

zingen crede (‘sing the creed’) should be read as scabrous allusions to masturbation and
sexual intercourse respectively. If this is correct, Reynaert and Cuwaert committed the sin
that should not be named in the Middle Ages (the crimen nefandum): homosexual love. See
in this context also 144—45. This interpretation is supported by a marginal decoration, depic—
ting a very frightened hare with a bloodied bottom, holding a book (cf. Meuwese 2006).

‘Heere, waer Reynaerd doot, het waer ons goet,
also behoude mi God mijn leven.
Neware wert hem dit vergheven,

hi sal noch hoenen binnen eere maent
sulken dies niet ne bewaent.’

Doe spranc up Grinbert die das,

die Reynaerts broedersone was,

met eere verbolghenlike tale:

‘Heere Ysengrijn, men weet dat wale
ende hets een hout bijspel:

viants mont seit selden wel.

Verstaet, neemt miere talen goem:

ic wilde, hi hinghe an eenen boem

bi ziere kelen als een dief

die andren heeft ghedaen meest grief.

162-64 The person bringing the charge can strengthen his case by supplying evidence.
That is why Pancer points to his relative Cuwaert’s fresh wounds. A well—known example
from Germanic legal practice is the complaint with the dead man: the victim’s body is
brought to the court of law by his relatives and is shown when the charge is made. This is
also the reason why Cantecleer will bring his daughter Coppe’s dead body to the court on
a bier (283—90).

177-282 In his plea for the defence Grimbeert the badger first proposes a reconciliation
between the fox and Ysingrijn, Reynaert’s most powerful enemy. He argues that this is the

170

175

his earlier lesson

and was up to his old tricks

and he had Cuwaert by the throat

and would have bitten his head off

if I had not accidentally

come to his aid at that moment.

See here the fresh wounds

as evidence, lord king,

which Cuwaert sustained by his doing.

If you leave unpunished in this way

the disturbance of your peace,

ignoring the verdict of your barons,

it will be held against your children

for many years to come.’

‘By God, Pancer, what you say is true,’

said Ysingrijn from where he stood.

‘Lord, it would be a good thing for us all

if Reynaert were dead, so help me God.

But if he is pardoned for this,

he is sure to trick within a month

those of us who are not prepared for it.’
Then Grimbeert the badger jumped up,

who was Reynaert’s brother’s son,

and spoke these angry words:

‘Lord Ysingrijn, as everyone surely knows

and it is an old saying:

Sweet words rarely fall from the enemy’s mouth.

Listen, pay attention to my words:

I would wish that the one who

has caused the other most grief

were hanged by the neck from a tree like a thief.

more appropriate as in his view the wolf has caused Reynaert more harm than the other way
around (177—202). When this clever counter—accusation is called a lie (203—4), Grimbeert
takes the time to support his claim (205—32), after which he disproves the actual charges made
against the fox. He interprets the rape as adultery between courtly lovers, the theft of the
sausage as the conﬁscation of stolen goods, and dismisses the attack on Cuwaert as a mas—
ter’s chastisement of a recalcitrant pupil (233—62). Finally Reynaert is depicted as a redeemed
sinner who now lives the life of a hermit and fasts (263—82). For the ﬁrst time in the story the
problem of the relationship between rhetoric and reality is raised (cf. pp. 21—22).

187-88 Grimbeert suggests that the wolf should make a promise of reconciliation and
accept a similar promise on the fox’s part.

208-16 In branch III ofthe Roman de Renart the fox shams death in the middle ofthe road
when a cartwith a load ofﬁsh approaches. When he has been tossed on to the cart on account
of his valuable pelt, he makes a meal of the ﬁsh (Martin 1882—1887, 1—164). Grimbeert twists

Lord Ysingrijn, should you wish

to agree to a settlement,

Iwill be pleased to assist.

My uncle will not make objections either.

And whoever is the worst miscreant,

whether it be my uncle or you,

he will owe the other party compensation.

Even though he is not now appearing to make a complaint,

if my uncle’s standing at court was high

and if he enjoyed the king’s favour

— as you do, Lord Ysingrijn —

the king would not approve of it

and you would not escape punishment this time

for having ravaged his skin

so often with your sharp teeth,

while he had no way of taking revenge.’
Ysingrijn spoke: ‘Have you learned

from your uncle to lie so blatantly?’

— ‘I have not told any lies.

You have deceived my uncle

very often and in many different ways.

You cheated him when he threw you

the plaice from the cart,

while you followed him at a distance

and picked up the best plaice

with which you satisﬁed your hunger.

You gave him nothing at all,

except for the bones of one single plaice,

which you offered him

because you did not fancy them any more.

Later you cheated him with a side of bacon

that had much fat on it and was very tasty,

which you took between your jaws.

this story in such a way that it makes Ysingrijn appear in a bad light. In the badger’s version
Reynaert is in the wolf ’5 company. In the same way as the wolf owes his success in appropri—
ating a ham to the fox, showing his gratitude by leaving nothing but the string from which
it was hung (217—19), he here devours the plaice that Reynaert throws down to him from the
cart, leaving nothing but the bones ofone single ﬁsh (cf. p. 31—32).

217-29 After the distorted story of the theft of the ﬁsh Grimbeert relates a shortened version
of the theft of the ham in branch V of the Roman de Renart (Martin 1882—1887, 1—148). In this
way the badger emphasizes once again the greed and malice of the wolf, who broke the agree—
ment to share the booty and fobbed Reynaert off with the string for hanging the side of bacon.
236 al haer lijfis ambiguous; it means both ‘all her life’ and ‘with all her body’. Cf. also 1978,

When Reynaert demanded his share,

you mocked him and said:

“I should like to give you your share,

Reynaert, my dear young man!

The string from which the bacon was hung,

chew on it, it is very greasy.”

Reynaert was little better off

for having got hold of the ﬁne side of bacon,

with the risk that someone

would catch him and toss him into his bag.

This grief and this trouble

he suffered through Ysingrijn’s doing

and a hunderd times more than I am telling you.
My lords, don’t you think this is enough?

It is the more disgraceful

that he complains of his wife

who has loved Reynaert

all her life, and he her.

Even though they did not make it known,

I dare declare as the truth

that for more than seven years

Reynaert has had her faithful devotion.

If a beautiful woman like Haersint

accommodated Reynaert

on account of her love and lecherous habits,

so what? She soon got over it.

Why bother wasting words on it?

Now Lord Cuwaert, the hare,

is turning a triﬂe into a complaint.

If he failed to read the creed as he should,

why should not Reynaert, his master,

be allowed to beat his pupil?

Surely, that would not be right.

243 Manuscript F reads dur haveschede instead of dor quads zede. The reading in the Com—
burg manuscript makes sense: by saying that the she—wolf loved Reynaert as she lacks
decency, Grimbeert implies that he disapproves of Haersint’s behaviour, hoping in this way
to impress the king favourably. Nevertheless the reading in F ﬁts the context better: after all,
Grimbeert means to argue that the fox and the she—wolf are courtly lovers.

245 This line is ambiguous; it means both ‘she soon got over it’ and ‘she soon reached a climax’.

Cortoys claghet om eene worst

die hi verloes in eene vorst.

Die claghe ware bet verholen:

ende hoerdi dat so was ghestolen?
Male quesite male perdite:

over rechtwert men qualike quite
dat men hevet qualic ghewonnen.
Wie sal Reynaerde dat verjonnen
of hi ghestolen goet ghinc an?
Niemen die recht versceeden can.
Reynaert es een gherecht man.
Sint dat die coninc sinen ban

hevet gheboden ende sinen vrede,
so weetic wel dat hi ne dede

dinc negheene dan of hi ware
hermite ofte clusenare.

Naest siere huut draecht hi een hare.
Binnen desen naesten jare

so ne hat hi vleesch, no Wilt no tam.
Dat seidi die ghistren danen quam.
Malcroys hevet hi begheven, [194rb]
sinen casteel, ende hevet upheven
eene cluse daer hi leghet in.

Ander bejach no ander ghewin

so wanic wel dat hi ne hevet

dan karitate die men hem ghevet.
Bleec es hi ende magher van pinen.
Hongher, dorst, scerpe karijnen
doghet hi voer sine zonden.’

Recht te desen selven stonden,

doe Grimbert stont in dese tale,
saghen si van berghe te dale
Canticler commen ghevaren,

ende brochte up eene bare

eene doode hinne ende hiet Coppe,

257 Garbled Latin for ‘male quaesita male perdita’, literally: ‘badly acquired, badly lost
goods’, or ‘stolen goods never thrive’.
